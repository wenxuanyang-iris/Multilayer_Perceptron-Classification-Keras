# Multilayer_Perceptron-Classification-Keras
This project demonstrates the usage of Keras, a neural network library, for performing image classification on the [*Fashion MNIST* dataset from *Zalando*](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). The goal is to build a multilayer perceptron model that achieves high accuracy in identifying different clothing items.

Project Overview
The tutorial has been modified and extended to work with the Fashion MNIST dataset. The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of 60,000 grayscale images belonging to 10 different classes, representing various clothing items.

The primary objective of this project is to train a multilayer perceptron model using Keras to accurately classify the clothing images into their respective categories. The model's performance will be evaluated using a separate test set consisting of 10,000 images.

Here's an example of how the data looks (*each class takes three-rows*):

### Labels
Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

| Label | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | T-shirt/top |
| 1 | Trouser |
| 2 | Pullover |
| 3 | Dress |
| 4 | Coat |
| 5 | Sandal |
| 6 | Shirt |
| 7 | Sneaker |
| 8 | Bag |
| 9 | Ankle boot |
